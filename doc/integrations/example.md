# DuckDB

```{note}
JupySQL also supports DuckDB with a native connection (no SQLAlchemy needed), to learn more, see [the tutorial](../integrations/duckdb-native.md). To learn the differences, [click here.](../tutorials/duckdb-native-sqlalchemy.md)
```

JupySQL integrates with DuckDB so you can run SQL queries in a Jupyter notebook. Jump into any section to learn more!
